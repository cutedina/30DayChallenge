        content: `<p>Welp, today: March 13th 2025, marks the first day of the challenge, huh‚Ä¶<br>
                    I really didn't expect that I‚Äôd follow through with it but it didn't sit right with me to do you dirty like that and then for everything to be back to normal without taking at least SOME sort of punishment.<br>
                    Although a bit extreme, I think I can afford to be sad for a month and then be happy later for reallll.<br>
                    (with you perhaps??? :3)<br>
                    Anyways, gosh knows how sad I was yesterday, I was pretty devastated not gonna lie.<br>
                    I started thinking of ways I could cope with this, or at least try to convince you that you really are my special pookie wookie, and I landed with making a website :D which is exactly what you‚Äôre seeing right now.<br>
                    <em>‚Ä¶well</em>, using the word ‚Äúexactly‚Äù is a bit of a stretch, as I have just started developing it so I'm not even sure of the final outcome of it, and I also started taking some coding lessons in three languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript, and I‚Äôd like to think that my hard work is beginning to show on godddd.<br>
                    Enough of that though, the whole point of this blog style website is to fill you in about my life, how I‚Äôm doing, etc‚Ä¶ to prove to you that no matter how far away we are from each other, there‚Äôs always going to be some sort of contact, even if it meant training a pigeon to send you a letter ;).</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>So, today was certainly a day alright:<br><br>
                    For one, I got to see you plenty of times, I was basking in the beauty for what I presumed would be the last time until the next semester, and it was ironic; You were wearing yellow, so you looked like the sun, and even though I wanted to stare for so long and even talk to you, I knew that I shouldn‚Äôt and that I couldn‚Äôt, but oh well.<br><br>
                    We also did an hour and a half of PE, I was really happy because I didn‚Äôt expect myself to do that well in Volleyball, as I had decided that it wasn‚Äôt for me last year when I barely got to improve and made the ball fly all the way to the roof at the end of year, but I was doing some really good plays with really good precision to boot, and also was no longer scared of the ball.<br>
                    My friend who played it with me a lot and tried coaching me before said that he was really proud of me, so I‚Äôm happy.<br>
                    Although my whole body felt sore by the end of it, and I was really thirsty.<br><br>
                    I‚Äôm not sure if it matters to you by the time you read this, but I got 17 in french, so that‚Äôs cool.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>We played Uno in class!<br>
                    After I got kicked out of your class (totally didn‚Äôt come to sneak a lil peek or two or anything nope nope nope), we formed a party of 13 and started playing the game! We did 2 games and they were hella fun, since we kept playing until we had a loser instead of finishing with the first winner.<br>
                    <em>‚Ä¶ I did get my butt handed to me, though‚Ä¶</em> It wasn‚Äôt pretty; I got hit with a +12 and immediately after it a +10, not only that, but all my cards were just number cards.<br>
                    I had no shot at victory with a deck of 20~ cards, so I decided to sabotage the person next to me, who was Amira. Yes, THAT Amira. She had 2 cards left.<br>
                    I was laughing my butt off at her, I was full on focusing on her and visualizing her cards, and I realized that she only had red and blue cards.<br>
                    So I put my cards to use and made it hell for her; Either by putting down yellow or green cards, giving her more cards, or downright just cancelling her turn.<br>
                    God I love being evil. I did win after that so that was cool.<br><br>
                    And then, I walked home with Fares and Nadjib, we were just yapping and yapping about the most random stuff on earth (mostly Fares bragging about his plays in Werewolf).<br>
                    My legs hurt a lot whilst walking, though. I already started having major pain by the time we got into school and it was way worse when I walked home.<br><br>
                    I did make it home though, so all‚Äôs good. (felt weird not taking a picture but what can I say)<br>
                    I immediately took a shower because duh. And then I lied down in bed for around an hour to rest.<br><br>
                    Then I got up, sat my butt down, and started learning to do the website. It's in its infancy stage, of course, it still will display this though!!<br><br>
                    It‚Äôs like 17:20 at the time, still a long time till I can drink so that‚Äôs unfortunate. I‚Äôm currently listening to a podcast and writing this stuff, maybe I‚Äôll end it here for today. I miss you a lot and I still love you.<br>
                    I reckon I should at least add an update at night, since I plan on sleeping in around 8 hours.</p>`

        content: `<p><em>I slept.</em><br>
                    Technically, by the time I would‚Äôve gotten around to writing an update to yesterday‚Äôs log, it was already March 14th, and I guess there‚Äôs no harm in adding the update here:</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>So, my brother made it home yesterday.<br>
                    Unfortunately for me that means I can not use my pc during the weekend, I hope that doesn‚Äôt spell any trouble for me when they invite me to play in the group chat, and I hope that by now you would have understood that too.<br>
                    My mom made a very yummy lunch/dinner, and she also made some sort of salty croissant? Won‚Äôt complain though, it tasted great.<br>
                    I got some work done on the website, and the prototype looks great.<br> 
                    It is basically fully functional by now, but I would like to add some more features; Maybe a different background which could be more aesthetic? Or custom made buttons for each day, and hell, even these journals might get some a little ak artistic touch too. I‚Äôll look into adding some music and sound effects as well.<br>
                    I ate some yummy desserts too.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>That was pretty much everything I did yesterday, for now I‚Äôll go pray Duhr and then I‚Äôll finish yapping about my early morning stuff<br>
                    LATERRRR</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p><em>It‚Äôs already around 9pm as I‚Äôm writing this‚Ä¶</em><br>
                    I didn‚Äôt expect that it‚Äôd get this late without me writing anything, but I guess now I‚Äôll do a full recap of today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So, I was using my laptop in bed, right? I was apparently so tired that I slept without even noticing and my mom came to check on me and put everything away in their proper places.<br>
                    <em>( Thanks, mom. )</em></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I then woke up feeling like broken legos for Suhor, and decided to only eat a little bit, drink like a camel, and then went right back to destroy my mattress.<br>
                    I didn‚Äôt immediately sleep, though. I was already pretty late in reading Quran ( I was at around page 202 ), and it is Friday, so I wanted to somehow someway get to Surat Al Kahf ( Spoiler alert: I made it üòõ). I read for around half an hour and then honk mimimi‚Äôd.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I woke up at around 9 am feeling hella devastated, as I had a silly, sad dream. You could probably call it a nightmare.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>In the dream, I was following pretty much real life, but I guess a bit into the future? Basically, I was writing these journals pretty much everyday, and making steady progress on the website.<br>
                    I was really happy with it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All of a sudden, I fell deathly ill. I was coughing up blood like crazy and could barely get anything done. I was cursing the whole world because I couldn‚Äôt even focus on working on the website or writing these.<br>
                    Before I knew it, I was hospitalized. I don‚Äôt know what had come over me in the dream, but I didn‚Äôt want to tell you about it. I felt too bad knowing that I was dying.<br>
                    Thus, I entrusted the project to Lou. I knew I hadn‚Äôt much time left, so I made sure to explain to her everything and when to send this website to you, gave her the link, and then wrote up a few messages for the last remaining week on my deathbed, and then I died.</p>
                    <p>I had really assumed the dream was my reality. It felt so realistic: Everything from the happiness I got from writing the journals, the devastation from not being able to work on them anymore, and the guilt that overcame me at the end of it all when I couldn‚Äôt meet your expectations. I didn‚Äôt doubt it all for a second, I didn‚Äôt go lucid.<br>
                    <em>But I hadn‚Äôt woken up.</em> I just turned into a wandering spirit, a lost soul.<br>
                    <em>‚Ä¶well,</em> so much for lost, I knew who I was and I retained all my memories and feelings for one.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was just biding my time, flying around and watching everyone from time to time, until it was April 12th.<br>
                    Are ya caught up in the story thus far? Pretty cool dream, yeah? WELL TOO BAD! Cause today ain‚Äôt your lucky day, pal, I woke up.<br>
                    Twasn‚Äôt my lucky day either, I had woken up feeling absolutely dreaded.</p>
                    <p>All the morale that I had going into this ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù was now all but destroyed, I‚Äôm now massively considering just chickening out of it on the day of your birthday. Heck, maybe I will.<br>
                    However, one thing I got out of it is that I massively, MASSIVELY adore your goofy ahh. My love for you remains unwavering, meaning I‚Äôm going to do my absolute bestest ( or maybe my second absolute bestest ) to appreciate you, and you only, by the end of this challenge, even if it ends prematurely.<br>
                    I realized that I have been taking you for granted for so long, so now I‚Äôm infinitely more determined to make this website a great thing! I hope that it might serve as some sort of token of goodwill from me to you‚Ä¶ hehehe, Kimkim-san to Sisi-kun. You really are my special one of a kind pookie. I will make sure to treat you really well after this whole thing.<br>
                    Oh well, that was a good dream nonetheless, I felt very warm and fuzzy by the end of it all, so, no harm, right?</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Anyways, after I woke up, everyone was asleep because it was 9 am and people do tend to sleep during Ramadan. I decided to read some Quran because Ion got anything better to do.<br>
                    I read it for around an hour and a half STRAIGHT, my top record yet, to this day. :D<br>
                    Actually saying to this day makes it sound wrong because it's a diary so SCRATCH THAT!!<br>
                    My mom then came to check on me when she woke up, so I decided to get my bum up as well and I went and prayed.<br>
                    ‚Ä¶I then proceeded to go right back to bed because my legs still hurt like crazy. I booted up my laptop and then wrote up the start of this log.<br>
                    I didn‚Äôt write much, though. It was already getting pretty late and I had to go to the mosque.<br>
                    So I did. I went there and it ended relatively quickly, which was neato, I guess.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My dad decided to take my brother out for another test drive, so I stayed behind and met with some friends and we just yapped and yapped and yapped until it was around 3:30pm.</p>
                    <p>I got home, took a shower because hot damn I was STINKY. And then I went back to bed, and this time I decided that instead of finishing today‚Äôs log, I would read Quran until I made it to Surat Al Kahf, no pauses.<br>
                    God knows how many pauses I took, LOL. I was taking some slight breaks from time to time to watch reels, felt like an absolute asshole when I saw some of the reels that you liked, and also indulged in some highly intellectual conversations in some group chats that I‚Äôm in.<br>
                    I did make it to page 304 before Maghreb though, so that‚Äôs a win in my books.<br>
                    Still, never did I think that I would read an astounding 100 PAGES in a single day. I‚Äôm sure you would be proud of me.<br>
                    Oh yeah, I‚Äôm soon approaching the point where you planned on beginning your reading in Quran. I hope that you listened to my condition and are reading it.<br>
                    I wouldn‚Äôt find it weird either if you started doing a plethora of activities now that I‚Äôm not in the picture anymore, for a month. Your sleeping schedule has already seen some MAJOR improvements.<br>
                    ‚Ä¶you still wake up hella late, though. ( you lazy cutie üíû )</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Nothing major happened from that point onwards; I had lunch, prayed, prayed again, brought dessert with me to bed, and I‚Äôm now writing this stuff at 10:23 pm.<br>
                    I guess one thing that could count is a loophole that I found. Technically, I‚Äôm not allowed to send you messages, right? So, I decided to just write notes only for you to see. I hope that you atleast saw one or two.<br>
                    ( And that the note with the song ‚ÄúIDGAF‚Äù isn‚Äôt directed to me, ahem. It really isn‚Äôt.)</p>
                    <br><br>
                   <p>Welp, I‚Äôm gonna end it here, I guess.<br>
                    I might continue learning how to code websites in order to be able to do quirky stuff later on.<br> 
                    But realistically, I‚Äôm probably just going to sleep.<br>
                    In that case, no matter how late you see this, I love you and I miss you so much. I genuinely wish I could talk to you right now.</p>
                    Sending you as many telepathic mwahs and hugs with your hair ties. üíûüíû</p>

        content: ` <p>Alrighty, it do be late at night now, like 11pm lol.<br>
                    I should have written this beforehand but GOD was I busy today.<br>
                    This is gonna be the shortest log in a veeeeery long time so rest easy, I'll just talk briefly about my day to update you and then I'll sleep.. maybe.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Alright so, I ended up sleeping at 3 am. Yes, that late.<br>
                    And you might be wondering what the hell was I doing up that late, and to that I say, this website.<br>
                    Yeah okay so, I had this brilliant idea to make a heart emoji that scrolls along with these journals, one that beats fast as you scroll and stuff.<br>
                    It's a really good idea, unfortunately my lack of knowledge in these languages massively hindered its creation.<br>
                    I had gotten it to work, only outside of the journals themselves which was stupid. I then tried using AI to help with it but they were already building off a really wrong idea so it didn't lead anywhere.<br>
                    I got frustrated and slept.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I woke up for Suhor a bit late and ate up, then went right back to bed cause why the heck not.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>My mom later woke me up because she and my dad planned on going out to buy some clothes. It was raining for a while which meant that we stayed home a bit longer than expected, and then once it stopped, my brother didn‚Äôt want to wake up no matter how much we called for him, leaving my mom to decide that she‚Äôs not going with him.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So, we pulled up in da car to Hassiba.<br>
                    I really like the place since I found some cool shops for my classic shenanigans.<br>
                    Anyways I decided to switch things up this time around and I bought clothes in beige, because, I don't know, colors and stuff. I wasn‚Äôt the proudest of it ‚Äòcause I kinda did it solely to satisfy my dad‚Äôs nagging, but it‚Äôs overall good. 7.5/10.<br>
                    I'm also going to buy a new pair of shoes like my current ones, but brown, and a brown belt to match with the outfit. That might bring it up to a solid.. 8/10.<br>
                    I look like a park ranger wearing em though so that's neat.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>We got back home at around 2 pm, and I immediately got to work on the website.<br>
                    I worked on it, and I worked, and I worked.<br>
                    I didn't take the slightest break trying to get the heart thing to work.<br>
                    WELL TOO BAD, I'm a dumbass and I couldn't make it work even after spending a total of 12 hours on that thing.<br>
                    Seriously, though, no amount of words could do justice to how frustrated I‚Äôm feeling because of it.<br>
                    Not that I don‚Äôt wanna do it or anything, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm currently too inexperienced with web development and web design, so the approach I tried for making the heart actually scroll, in the correct place, whilst being animated to boot, ended up being a complete and utter dud.<br>
                    I might have to consider just making the heart scroll but not beat, which is so sad.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Either way at the time of writing this the website is hella broken, I'll fix it ASAP tomorrow. I hope that by the time you receive this website the heart thing's gonna be there.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Speaking of, I'm currently planning on delivering this site to you on your birthday. It is the smallest thing I can offer you as a gift so my apologies in advance.<br>
                    Nothing else of note happened today, really. MY MOM DID MAKE TACOS FOR LUNCH, THOUGH!!!! YUMMY YUMMERS. üòã</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Aside from that I did the usual shower; Take my brother to his school and everything else.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I wonder if you went to the thing they told us about.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Goddamn it's 11:45 pm and we're both still up, what a buncha losers, am I right?<br>
                    Wait, nevermind that, you went around 15 minutes ago. Still a buncha losers.<br>
                    Just kidding, you really shoulda blocked me there, pal. Because it's paining me more than anything to not be able to message you all the time.</p>
                    <br><br><br>

                    Well, well, I woke up for Suhor as usual and DIDN‚ÄôT go back to sleep, YEAAAAAH LEVELING UP BIG TIME AM I RIGHT?? OR AM I RIGHT???<br>
                    Is what I‚Äôd say if I actually didn‚Äôt sleep.. Well, ya see‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt wash my hair yesterday like a silly goose, so I wanted to wash it today early in the morning so I can go to school without looking like crap.<br>
                    But I made a slight miscalculation, namely going back to bed and doom scrolling for the billionth time. I slept minutes before I had intended to wake my lazy butt up and get busy.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Ended up oversleeping, but I still managed to get everything done in time including picking out my clothes so that was cool. Speaking of, I haven‚Äôt worn this shirt in ages, you know, the red and black button-down shirt? Yeah, I haven‚Äôt worn it ever since November or something like that, back when you took a picture of me all the way from your class. That sure was a fun time.<br>
                    I‚Äôm still confused on why you showed it to your mother, though. üòõ</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Ah, right. You sure were <em>green</em> today, huh? Still, that green outfit looked great on you, super cool with how you‚Äôre keeping your hair more down as of recently. I‚Äôm not sure which one I prefer but it‚Äôs not like I ever had a say in this, yeah? You‚Äôre still hella pretty all the way.<br>
                    ‚Ä¶can I by any chance call you my four-leaf clover? Cause you‚Äôre my lucky find :)</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Okay, that‚Äôs corny, I agree with that much.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Back on topic, I love it so much when we don‚Äôt study like this, this is the only part I enjoy about school; I just wanna go to school, grab a chair and chill with my buddies. Gosh, that‚Äôs bliss.<br>
                    I‚Äôm not sure why the Arabic teacher still tries to teach us, when over half the class isn‚Äôt present.<br>
                    At least the Physics teacher didn‚Äôt care the slightest bit that I was the only one in class not writing, not sure if it‚Äôs nepotism.<br>
                    NOT GONNA COMPLAIN, THOUGH!!! I spent the good part of like 40 minutes just yoinking papers at Hichem, who by the by, was coincidentally writing on the board. ( The coincidence part is a lie, she saw him wearing his cap and made him write on the board, hehe. )</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Morning classes went by just fine, and I was planning on saying my goodbyes for the semester. But nooo, everyone decided it‚Äôs a good time to actually come to class. So I caved in and also went to class since no one wanted to skip with me anymore.<br>
                    Wasn‚Äôt all in vain, in fact, we played Uno again!<br>
                    Yeah, so, we would‚Äôve had empty periods from 11:45 am until 2 pm, right? But the English teacher is so magnanimous, so she ‚Äúbabysat‚Äù us during the first period. I say babysat because we immediately started playing Uno.<br>
                    My grudge and wrath against Amira still goes strong!! I purposefully plopped myself down right next to her so I could absolutely screw with her whole life, on god.<br>
                    I‚Äôm treating it like it‚Äôs a life-long grudge, but no, just two dummies messing with each other. I managed to make her lose twice so that‚Äôs cool.<br>
                    Sadly, the 45 minutes went by too fast, and it was already time for us to leave.<br>
                    HAFIDA THOUGH!!! THE CLUTCH!!! THE MARVELOUS PLAYS!!! OH WHAT A SAVE!!!<br>
                    Yeah, she told us that was can stay in class if we have no one to pick us up, SO IT‚ÄôS BACK TO ROUND 2 BABYYY!!!<br>
                    I was kinda upset with her earlier because she kept nagging me about my‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the white thingy that we have to wear called?? Either way, I guess she made it up unknowingly. She would‚Äôve been cursed by my endless wrath had she not done that, wise choice.<br>
                    This time, we decided to play with the 0-7 rule; it‚Äôs a rule where if you put down a number 7 card, you have to switch your deck with someone else‚Äôs deck, and if you put down a 0, all the decks get passed around from person to person depending on the direction of the game. It‚Äôs basically a rule made solely to wreak havoc; a chaos pandora‚Äôs box.<br>
                    I, too, am very magnanimous, so I listened to Amira‚Äôs pleas to not absolutely crap on her, and we decided to team. A legendary duo.<br>
                    Unfortunately, the game got cut short by none other than HAFIDA THAT *****. Sorry, trying my best not to curse. But god damn that was annoying, she made us stop playing when she saw us.<br>
                    Why, you might ask? Oh, you‚Äôre so silly! The answer is so obvious: It‚Äôs because <em>we were gambling‚Ä¶</em> That upsets me so much I want to bang my head against the wall.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>But gosh, I love that game. I want to finish what we had started so I‚Äôm currently trying to convince everyone in the group chat to play it on Roblox, I know a super fun game there that has so many different rules and themes to choose from! I hope it goes well.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>‚Ä¶It didn‚Äôt go well‚Ä¶<br>
                    Not only did Fares do a Fares, but I also had no idea what issues you had in the game. And then no one else wanted to play.<br>
                    That sucked. It was nice that we at the very least played a few scuffed games of Among Us.<br>
                    What sucked even more is the fact that you joined the call to tell me not to send you snaps anymore. Thing is, I sent those snaps to everyone, not just you, so it completely crossed my mind that you were being spammed by me.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Still, this really does put a wrench in my plans. I don‚Äôt even think that you‚Äôll take kindly to this website anymore‚Ä¶ Here I was planning on doing some silly stuff just to be able to talk to you or see you.<br>
                    Like messaging you two days before you have to take your vitamin D, so I can act like I don‚Äôt know when it will be even though I do, and after you‚Äôll say ‚ÄúIn 2 days‚Äù, I would text you the day after to remind you that it would be tomorrow, and then on the day, I would remind you in Suhor. Or sending you this website on the day of your birthday, so that even if we don‚Äôt talk, you might be able to see my progress for the following two weeks.<br>
                    Or even going to your class from time to time just to see you. But I‚Äôm guessing you want to fully cut contact for a month... Do you just want me to disappear from your life?<br>
                    I don‚Äôt really know anymore. I think I‚Äôll take a break from writing.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I‚Äôll finish this later.</p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <p>I‚Äôm in bed now.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I really didn‚Äôt expect anything like that to happen. You sounded so upset at just the fact that I dared do something with you.<br>
                    That did switch my mood, true, but it didn‚Äôt leave me completely demotivated from working on the website. I had enough drive in me to finish what I had started earlier today.<br>
                    I think I‚Äôve finished up work on the heart. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll ever pick it back up, but as of now, it‚Äôs just a pink heart that has a little glow to it and scrolls pretty fluidly. On pc, at least. My tests on my phone didn‚Äôt go any better so I‚Äôm totally giving up making it work there.<br>
                    See, I had great ambitions to animate the heart; to make it beat whilst idle, and beat even more intensely whilst scrolling, and to shake violently whilst being hovered over. It‚Äôs what I spent so long working on, after all.<br>
                    But I realized that with the way I wrote my spaghetti code, it wasn‚Äôt possible. It‚Äôs either it scrolls or it animates; no in-between.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I took the tough decision of cutting out the animations.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I was going to consider beginning work on the art for the website, but I didn‚Äôt have any inspirations, nor the drive to just start drawing some buttons and the background and stuff.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>My dad‚Äôs aunt came to have lunch with us, but I was already so out of it.<br>
                    I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôll try and see to it so that I try to ignore your presence tomorrow. I‚Äôll work harder on the website.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Just don‚Äôt be upset at me anymore.</p>`

                    Well, that doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, because it‚Äôs a new day, and it‚Äôs a new me‚Ä¶ maybe.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Well, well, it‚Äôs the fifth entry in the Journal Logs, so that means it‚Äôs the sixth day that we‚Äôve cut contact. Yup, the math adds up beautifully.<br>
                    Seriously though, I totally should‚Äôve made a Journal Log 0, like, as a prologue. Actually, that should‚Äôve been Journal Log 1. Oh well, missed opportunity. Wait, hold on, <em>does that mean Journal Log 30 will be after April 12th</em>??? I‚Äôm not even gonna think about it anymore.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Either way, I can‚Äôt tell whether time is flying or taking its sweet sweet time, because, gosh, it sure feels that way.<br>
                    I just wanna talk to you again, one more time.<br>
                    I regret everything that I have done, and that I haven‚Äôt done, to upset you. I wish I could just turn back time or something and fix it. This is hell.<br>
                    I oughta take some punishment for my mistakes, in fact, I won‚Äôt dwell on this any longer, I should let all my emotions boil up so that I can write a truly heartfelt <em>Journal Log 16</em>. ( Oh, the marvelous foreshadowing! )</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Wait, what am I supposed to talk about then?? Truly a conundrum for the modern age.<br>
                    Right, I‚Äôll just yap about today.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>YAP SESSION: COMMENCE!!</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Right, right. So, Monday. I‚Äôm thinking of skipping the talk about Suhor, because at this point, I‚Äôm just waking up, eating, and sleeping.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I also saw my cat walking on the street and he came running up to me so I gave him some head pats and chin scratches.<br>
                    Pat pat pat :3</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>ONTO SCHOOL!! Yeah okay so, I genuinely didn‚Äôt expect a single person to come to school.<br>
                    Sounds dumb, yes. But I wholeheartedly believed that maybe only 5-10 people would come, not close to 20.<br>
                    It was still hella fun though, the History teacher is a goat for letting us play one of my favorite board games ever, one that is so great I want to play it all the time.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>..Yeah, it‚Äôs Uno.<br>
                    I do be sounding like a broken record speaking about it, but MAN is the game fun to play with enough people.<br>
                    Anyways, we played it again. We put two tables together and squeezed ourselves all together to play.<br>
                    I‚Äôm not sure how many of the people that played with us you know, but there was Nadjib, Hichem, Sizziani (@hs_kurma, the guy in the group chat that calls me baddiewi or badihwi), Amira, Cilia, The twins Bel9adi, and honorable mention: Me üëÖ<br>
                    ( More commonly known as Akram, Ak, Ak-47, Akku-chan, Kerrouma or KimKim )<br>
                    It was really fun with all the chaos happening at the same time. Fares did try killing me a bunch of times so that‚Äôs awesome.<br>
                    Oh yeah, seeing Hichem laughing at the door and then seeing you standing there gave me a real scare.<br>
                    No matter, though. You looked really blue and pretty today, all that‚Äôs missing is for you to wear red tomorrow since you wore yellow on Thursday, green yesterday ( Sunday ), and blue today!<br>
                    Ah well, playing was fun until idara came and ruined our day. They made us get all separated and stuff so that was mega lame.<br>
                    We invoked the wrath of the enemies of fun, I guess.<br>
                    I was coerced into not coming that evening, because a bunch of kids from my class were saying that if I skip, they‚Äôll skip as well.<br>
                    Couldn‚Äôt see you that evening, but I hope I can tomorrow :)</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Little bit of a timeskip here, but we ended up playing Among Us :D<br>
                    Sadly, you were asleep or something, not sure which. But it was a lotta fun!! I was the impostor 3 times in a row and was just goofing around altogether, I lowkey killed Maya as well on accident but it worked out in the end.<br>
                    I did get ganged up on by both Maya and Lina though, so that‚Äôs something.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I didn‚Äôt do work on the website today, I‚Äôve just been trying out random stuff from the course and also looking at people‚Äôs journeys with making websites. I also tried looking at different art styles and stuff because I do be garbage at art.<br>
                    I want to draw a few stuff for you :D</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Whoopsy daisy. I‚Äôm now in bed despite how early it is. ( Ahem 10 pm )<br>
                    I kind of fought with my dad, again. But I‚Äôll get to it later.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>So, we had lunch. My mom made a really yummy lunch despite how simplistic it was, though at this point, I only look forward to lunch so I can drink my heart out ( Grape flavored IFruit is so goated ).</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>After that, dad went to his room and I went to my office/gaming room. Mom was cleaning the kitchen after we had finished everything.<br>
                    A little while before Isha, she came to me crying asking me to come help.<br>
                    So, for context, she was ‚Äúdeep cleaning‚Äù the glass top gas stove, and at some point, all four igniters on the stove started sparking electricity.<br>
                    In short, water leaked through somewhere somehow and introduced a short circuit.<br>
                    I shut off the circuit breaker for the stove, and told her that it‚Äôs fine, as long as my dad doesn‚Äôt find out, we‚Äôll just dry it out with a blow dryer tomorrow. Besides, she can just turn on the fire using a lighter since the gas works just fine.<br>
                    ‚Ä¶She told my dad, and he went ballistic.<br>
                    Started yelling at her and stuff like he ever did anything, berating her to her face whilst she broke down crying. And then to add insult to injury, he started berating her, loudly, to my face:<br>
                    ‚ÄúYour mom is so useless, so replaceable‚Äù<br>
                    ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to tell you this, but you should know that your mom is the worst possible example for you‚Äù and stuff like that.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>That pissed me off. Rightfully so.<br>
                    Anyways a few fights and stuff happened and I ended up going to bed.<br>
                    Can‚Äôt be a true diary if I don‚Äôt talk crap about my dad at least once.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Kind of sad how you lot tried playing Among Us, but couldn‚Äôt organize yourselves, lame.<br>
                    I‚Äôll try organizing stuff tomorrow so that we can play together, I wanna talk to you again :P</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Anyways, I do be tired from all this, so I‚Äôm going to sleep. I wonder if I‚Äôll see you tomorrow.</p>`

        content: ` <p>Writing this right after Isha.<br>
                    I‚Äôm in a super good mood today, everything was nice. I got some inspiration for the website so I‚Äôm gonna look into the stuff tomorrow. I even fixed some little bugs that were happening with the text rendering.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I‚Äôm really happy that I got to interact with you a lot today :3</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>So so sososososososo:<br>
                    I really didn‚Äôt expect to go to school today. I had ‚Äúagreed‚Äù beforehand with the others that we wouldn‚Äôt go today, so I went back to bed after Suhor fully expecting to sleep.<br>
                    And well, I did, but my silly ahh forgot to turn off my alarm for 9 am, so I ended up waking up early, and as bored as I was, I decided to check my phone and lo and behold, my friends are in class?? OUR CLASSES DIDN‚ÄôT EVEN START YET.<br>
                    Out of sheer boredom, I decided to get ready for school, and then I headed there. Amira and Nadjib came as well.<br>
                    Once we got in, we were 6 kids in some random class, and yet the Science teacher still decided to teach us like we were a full class. Fun.<br>
                    There goes our plan to just fool around in class until 11:30 am.<br>
                    No matter though, because we had Islamic education after that, surely he won‚Äôt give us a lesson.<br>
                    ..He gave us a lesson.<br>
                    I admit though, it was a relatively fun one. We just began the lesson on divorce so it was interesting learning about it.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Probably the biggest surprise was seeing you leaving school, I didn‚Äôt even know that you were there to begin with. You did zoom past me though, huh.<br>
                    Sadly, no red outfit today. ( there goes the dream. I still made sure to stare, gotta appreciate beauty. )</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Anywho, I ended up going home as soon as possible, I just took Nadjib with me and we bolted straight home. We did talk a bunch on the way so that‚Äôs neato.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Upon making it home, my old man wasn‚Äôt here so I grabbed my mom‚Äôs hair dryer and made sure to dry up the stove, even though enough time had passed for it to have dried up. ( Not to mention the fact that my mom was cooking with literal fire, so yeah. )<br>
                    I turned back on the circuit breaker and it worked just fine. My mom was super relieved and happy, and I was left confused as to why he can‚Äôt ever think rationally for once in his life.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I had a lot of fun playing with you after that. We did Among Us, remember? I‚Äôm gonna make sure to enjoy these little play sessions as much as possible, because they‚Äôre pretty much the only times where I can talk to you.<br>
                    That does remind me, I‚Äôm planning on messaging you for the first time in a week tomorrow. Even though I know that you took your vitamins on Friday, and that you‚Äôre supposed to take them two days from now on Saturday, I‚Äôll pretend like I don‚Äôt know to squeeze out just the extra day of talking to you. I hope you won‚Äôt be mad that I ‚Äúforgot‚Äù and even more mad when you‚Äôre reading this.<br>
                    <em>...Seriously though, a week has passed already??</em><br>
                    Back on topic, it was pretty fun playing with everyone. I accidentally swore to god that it wasn‚Äôt me when you died the first round, even though I meant it as a joke because I thought that Maya was the impostor and that her plan was to pin it on me saying something like ‚ÄúHe wants you all to believe that he would never kill her!‚Äù.<br>
                    Was funny seeing you tweaking out after I got voted out, though.<br>
                    I‚Äôm surprised you weren‚Äôt impostor a single time, I guess you are just a goody two shoes in the end. I did want to see whether you would kill me or not if you ended up being an impostor at some point. Maybe later at night we‚Äôll see, when everyone comes back and we play again.<br>
                    I did vow to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt kill you if I did end up being the impostor, because we were vouching for each other a lot and stuff.<br>
                    ..Nah, I just didn‚Äôt want to kill you, no tactical advantage for me out of it.<br>
                    I was so close to winning that one game where I accused Samy of being it, and where Lina was being very suspicious. I still ended up losing because I played too aggressively in the end. Icarus flew too close to the sun, I guess.<br>
                    What I didn‚Äôt expect was the total baby tantrum crash out from Samy, like come on nobody complained when they died or got voted off, and besides, I placed reasonable suspicion on you and you didn‚Äôt disprove it which got you deported back to Mexico. No point being immature about it.<br>
                    You handled it pretty awesomely though! Can‚Äôt expect anything less from you, THE ALPHAAAA!!!</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>After that, I got pretty bored, so I was just scrolling around and replying to my messages and the like.<br>
                    I did go run some errands, though. My grandma sent me to buy soft drinks and seasoning and jambo and milk.<br>
                    I can‚Äôt tell if I was just tired or if Ramadan cooked me up, but I forgot half the stuff she told me to buy 5 minutes after she did. Two trips to the grocery store it is, then.<br>
                    Second one wasn‚Äôt all a waste, though. I saw a cute stray kitty just basking in the sunlight and rolling around on the sidewalk, so I made sure to give him the certified ak pet pet pet treatment. All da headpats and chin strokes for the cutest kitties.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Oh yeah, I decided to message Hichem to play with him. I‚Äôve never played with him before ( aside from one time when he was still together with Lou ), but I was so bored that some part of me decided that I could probably beat him in some game he plays a lot.<br>
                    It‚Äôs a fighting game in roblox, I know that gang used to play it alot, and it‚Äôs anime based so I guess they like that kind of stuff.<br>
                    Either way, I had fun playing with him. I did get tossed around at first because I had no idea how the game worked, but after I got the hang of it, I did really well.<br>
                    Samou joined us too, and with less than an hour of playtime, I was already sweeping the floor with him so that was a great ego boost.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>That‚Äôs pretty much everything that I did today, I will admit I‚Äôm already being very lazy because of the break and whatever. OH! I guess I won‚Äôt go to school tomorrow, since you‚Äôre not going either, or at least I assume that you won‚Äôt, based on the first semester.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I won‚Äôt be able to see you anymore :(</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Also, I‚Äôm guessing they aren‚Äôt going to play anything today, so I might as well go to bed nice and early today.<br>

                    I gotta admit, I haven‚Äôt been this bored in a while. Ah well, it <em>is</em> pretty early, so I guess that is subject to change.</p>

                    <p>Hi there, dear reader whom I love and adore very much!!<br>
                    I have to say, though‚Ä¶ You just couldn‚Äôt have been more off the mark about the fact that I will cease to see you in a romantic light if I just stopped talking to you. These feelings are so strong that not talking to you is just making ‚Äòem stronger. Out of the frying pan, into the fire, I guess.<br>
                    Heh‚Ä¶ I guess I just really like you then, huh?<br>
                    <em>Corny.</em></p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Anywho, it hasn‚Äôt been long since I woke up, and I woke up feeling like crap. Probably bad sleep after Suhor.<br>
                    It doesn‚Äôt help either that I immediately went to my pc after getting out of bed, after scrolling for a bit on my phone.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I really didn‚Äôt do anything, I just read Quran for a bit. I‚Äôm so happy about the fact that I‚Äôm not that far away from the point where you‚Äôre supposed to start ( if you haven‚Äôt started yet, that is ), so I finally reached you :)</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I‚Äôm going to watch some Youtube, I guess.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I Just finished a 2 hour gaming session with Hichem :D<br>
                    We played the same game as yesterday starting from 12pm, and Manale was there as well!<br>
                    I think I‚Äôve gotten plenty good at the game, as I‚Äôm able to go toe to toe with Tsu even though he knows the mechanics way more than I do, and I can wash the floor with Manale, heheh.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Oo, my brother won‚Äôt be coming this weekend, that‚Äôs nice. Now I can play for the next whole week. Yay.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Thinking about him made me play a game that he really likes. I watched him play it for a few hours but never understood the lore behind it, plus it was very late at night, close to 3 am. I didn‚Äôt finish it but I sure as heck had fun.<br>
                    It‚Äôs such an interesting game, it‚Äôs called Katana Zero. I‚Äôm sure that it doesn‚Äôt interest you the slightest bit, but I‚Äôll try to explain it briefly:<br>
                    Okay, so, Katana Zero is a 2D action platformer, it takes place in a dystopian city called New Mecca ( just thought it‚Äôs funny so I should mention it). The main protagonist is a psychopath; He is sort of a samurai assassin with the ability to manipulate time ( Slow motion, rewind time and stuff ), which he uses to predict the outcome of events and avoid death. In short, he‚Äôs immortal. He has no recollection of his past, so he sees a psychiatrist, who asks him about his dreams every night, and gives him some contracts of who to kill and who to kidnap and stuff like that, before administering him some <em>medicine.</em> He gains notoriety as ‚ÄúThe Dragon‚Äù from his mass murders, and slowly begins to unravel his past through the game.<br>
                    It‚Äôs REALLY a fun game for me, my only nitpick about it is that the dialogue is sometimes way too long, I wish there was just a rush mode where I can go and kill like a maniac.<br>
                    Both my brother and I thought that the game would be about a samurai dude in a futuristic world, who is haunted by nightmares and maybe something else, but DANG, we didn‚Äôt expect this story. 10/10 game.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I‚Äôm not even finished with the game so I have to make some time for it soon. Maybe some other  games as well, I‚Äôll see to it.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Oo, I just came across a song I used to really like a few years back; It‚Äôs called Reincarnation Apple by PinocchioP. Yes yes, if you decide to listen to it it‚Äôs probably going to sound unusual, but I think that‚Äôs the part that I like. The animation also looks hella good, like a fever dream of sorts.<br>
                    I hope that in a few years I get recommended Mushoku Tensei once more, genuinely one of my favorite stories that I have read as a guy who never reads stuff. I will read it again at some point, I promise myself. It‚Äôs like 60-70 THOUSAND words per volume, so in total I would have over 2 MILLION words to read. EEE I'M SO EXCITED FOR SOMETHING THAT HASN'T EVEN HAPPENED YET!</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>A little bit of a timeskip here, this is right after we finished our Gartic Phone games!<br>
                    I may have lied a bit about the fact that I was going to bed, I just merely wished to finish writing today‚Äôs entry in the L O G.<br>
                    Sosososo, I super duper enjoyed playing with you today, I‚Äôm glad we had so much fun in Among Us and stuff; Sadly you weren‚Äôt the impostor a single time, but you did get the seeker once. Also god DAMN that mode is scary, like from the music to the setting to the BEEPING when the seeker is close. 10/10 mode, would be infinitely better on call as well.<br>
                    As for Gartic Phone‚Ä¶ YOU FREAK, I didn‚Äôt know you were like that, though the drawings were really good, I was laughing my butt off the whole time at the prompts and the drawings we did. I had a lot of fun :)<br>
                    I even had a dream today where we played a bunch of random roblox games together and talked a whole bunch, so I‚Äôm glad to see that something like that happened.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Okay, you lot just finished absolutely leaking da crap out of my old pictures. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm really happy that she did that; had the roles been reversed, everyone would‚Äôve gone ballistic, but hey, can‚Äôt have what you want in this world. Not every man gets his wish.<br>
                    Though for that one specific picture, I WASN‚ÄôT CRYING!!! Seriously, I was just laying back thinking of how much I had fucked up in the physics test and Mehdi took a W picture of me.<br>
                    I should‚Äôve gone to sleep before any of this had happened. No, in fact, I should‚Äôve gone to sleep before any of what‚Äôs happening happened. This fucking gore shit knocked the ever fucking living lights out my will to sleep. I was so sleepy but now I genuinely want to die. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to be able to sleep <em>at all</em>. What a joke.<br>
                    I really should say this in the group chat now that you‚Äôre fighting them there, but I don‚Äôt really wanna intrude with your business. I know that it‚Äôs probably a lost cause because I tried stopping certain people once from watching gore, but they‚Äôre literally a lost cause. I also know that you‚Äôre going to be massively upset at me, and that this group chat is going to be barely holding onto life from now on, but I don‚Äôt want to deal with this, not now, not ever.<br>
                    Seriously, what the fuck??? It‚Äôs gore, god damn it. It's real, living people who‚Äôve had families and friends and entire years of experience in life, being recorded in their helpless state, and they watch that? What do you gain from watching it? Do you get off from seeing the life being driven out of their eyes? Do you enjoy seeing people driven into such corners mentally and physically that their only choice is to take their own lives? I‚Äôm genuinely so disgusted by them. I know that I am no greater than the next person, but I don‚Äôt watch gore; just because I can, doesn‚Äôt mean I should. Hell, if I have the time for that, I‚Äôd rather go do something useful with my life, read Quran or watch a fun show; laugh at jokes, not people‚Äôs demise.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I can‚Äôt sleep at all. My whole fun night ended off on such a shit note. It‚Äôs way past midnight, and Suhor, even, so all this talk should be in the next log, but I can‚Äôt be bothered at all anymore, my mood is in fucking shambles.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I decided to go work out after this whole mess; I worked out for around an hour and a bit, pushing myself even more than usual just to by some miracle of god, forget all this shit. I just realized that despite having tried so much to keep this diary curse free, that all went to shit now.<br>
                    I fell asleep on a couch inside my ‚Äúoffice‚Äù whilst resting for a bit, so at least I got some sleep in.<br>
                    I ended up waking up a tad late for Suhor, so I ate only a little bit, and didn‚Äôt drink jackshit. Way to go.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I don‚Äôt even know if I want to play later today, fucking weirdos. My mental state is in such shit that I decided not to even send you a message about the vitamin D stuff.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>I‚Äôll just go, man. Goodnight üíû</p>`
